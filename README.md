## Overview

Welcome to my 2D Minecraft-like video game developed in Python using the Pygame library! This project was created to explore game development concepts and showcase my skills in programming, game design, and problem-solving.

## Features

- **2D Block Building**: Players can place and remove blocks, similar to Minecraft's creative mode.
- **Player Movement**: Intuitive controls for character movement and interaction.
- **Open world**: A procedural, infinite, consistent world generated as the user moves around.
- **Dynamic Environment**: A colorful sky and ocean background that adds depth to the game world.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: The primary programming language used for development.
- **Pygame**: A set of Python modules designed for writing video games, providing functionalities like graphics and sound.
- **Git**: Version control to manage changes to the codebase.

## Getting Started
