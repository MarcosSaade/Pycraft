![pycraft](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/95125351-6839-4d92-8c58-ff66671c28da)

## Overview

**Pycraft** is a lightweight 2D game built in Python using Pygame, inspired by Minecraft's creative mode.  
Explore an infinite procedural world, build structures, and interact with a dynamic environment!
I built it while in High School as a side project and it was tons of fun and a great learning experience in game development, procedural generation, and working with graphics libraries like Pygame.

## Features

- **2D Block Building**: Place and remove blocks freely, just like Minecraft's creative mode.
- **Player Movement**: Smooth and intuitive controls for navigating the world.
- **Procedural Open World**: The environment expands infinitely as the player explores new regions.
- **Dynamic Background**: Colorful sky and ocean backgrounds enhance the visual experience.
